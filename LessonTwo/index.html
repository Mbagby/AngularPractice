<!-- Questions

1) What does ng-model do?
ng-model binds the view into the model. It gives you the controller for the ngModel directive. Allows you to get input and text area information. 

2) What is "dirty checking"? (Digest Cycle)
Dirty checking allows for Angular to watch for variables that may or may ot exist. It watches for when a variable changes. Scans the scope for changes. Takes a while (slow).

3) Find a way to set the initial value of "name" as "BoJack"(without writing a controller).
Use ng-init. See index.html

4) What are those {{ }} expressions? Are they Handlebars?
Markup. They are to bind expressions to elements. (Expression Binding)

5) Explain what 2-way data binding is.
It produces a "live view". Continually updating the page. Any changes made on the view are immediately reflected in the model and vice versa.

6) BONUS: Research the $digest loop
Digest cylcle. Relates to the idea of dirty checking. Code that runs inside the Angular event loop.
