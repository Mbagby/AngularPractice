<!-- Questions

1) What are Angular modules? Why use them?
A container for the different parts of your app. (Controllers, services, filters, etc.) Angular apps don't have a main method. Modules specify how an application should be bootstrapped. Why? Easier to understand. Package code as reusable modules. Can be loaded in any order. Unit tests are faster b/c they only load relevant modules. End to end tests can use modules to override configuration.

2) What the hell is $scope? It is an execution context for expressions. They copy the DOM sturcture of the application. It is an object that refers to the application model.

3) What are Angular modules? See Question 1

4) Why do we pass in $scope as an argument to controller functions? Because the $scope allows us to use that information in our view. Makes it automatically avialble in our view.
