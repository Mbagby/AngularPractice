<!-- Questions

1) Why learn Angular JS over other frameworks like Ember, Backbone, Knockout, etc?

Angular is the most common new framework. Angualar because it is newer took "a lot of what Ember does and made it even easier". It requires fewer lines of code and doesn't user setters and getters for data binding. Easier to understand other people's code in angualar. Ember and Angular are pretty similar. 

2) People have some very strong opinions about Angular. What are 3 common complaints people have about Angular?

1. Clarity: Angular code blurs the line between front and back end.
2. Parsing: Angular instructions requires it to parse the entire DOM. It is very expensive to do this especially on mobile.
3. Restrictive: Forces you to work in one specific way. Using angular JS contstraints is the highest level of productivity. (But then...isnt that why you use Angular. Not sure this is a great complaint)
4. Data Binding: Similar to what I said was a pro about Angular (in reference to data binding), many individuals run into limitation because it imposes restrictions on an application. 

3) Is Angular an MVC framework?

MVC framework stands for Model, View, and Controller. Angular brings MVC to the front end.

4) Why did I say jQuery is "sort of" a dependency of Angular? Does it depend on it or not?!

Angular uses jQLite automatically. Including jQuery the full version allows you to use all of the jQuery library.

5) Read the docs for ng-app. What is it and what does it do?

It designates the root element of the application. It allows you to "autoBootstrap" and Angular application. (Starting up your Angular app) -->
